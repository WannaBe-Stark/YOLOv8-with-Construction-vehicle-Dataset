# YOLOv8-with-Construction-vehicle-Dataset

### Abstract
This github repository is made for basic deep learning class term project. For the safety of the construction site, the dataset was directly constructed. Object detection and segmentation using the YOLOv8 model were performed using the built dataset.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of nine class images of construction machines and vehicles, Bulldozer, Dump truck, Excavator, Forklift, Loader, MEWP, Mobile Crane, Remicon, and Scraper, as well as txt annotation file and yaml file created using roboflow. To download the dataset, click the link below.
